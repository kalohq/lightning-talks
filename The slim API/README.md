# the slim API

Right alongside naming things, designing a good API is one of the hardest things in software engineering. Whether you’re working on an open library, an HTTP API or just on internal business logic, I’m pretty sure you’ve wondered “how on earth do I write this so it doesn’t confuse people?”

But what if APIs were good by default?

In this talk, we’ll see some solid patterns from functional programming languages that help people create APIs so great that they hardly need documentation. Right next, we’ll see if you can apply those patterns in the thing you’re building right now. And of course, in the language you’re building it in.
