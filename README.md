## how to give a talk

1. Come up with a good topic ğŸŒˆ
2. **Create new readme file** i.e. `PEP-666-curly-braces-in-python.md` in the root directory named after your talk ğŸ‘†
3. Describe what youâ€™ll be speaking about in the file content ğŸ“£

**ğŸ¤© give your talk ğŸ¤©**

You may choose to work on your talk in a separate branch which you squash and merge into master only after your talk is given. It's up to you.
