# Kalo lightning talks

## how to give a talk

1. Come up with a good topic 🌈
2. Create new directory named like your talk, with a README.md inside 👆
3. The rest of the directory is yours to use as you like! 👨‍🚀
4. **Give your talk 🤩**

You may choose to work on your talk in a separate branch which you squash and merge into master only after your talk is given. It's up to you.
